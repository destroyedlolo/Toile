# Toile
**Toile** is framework to create interactive dashboards.
It emancipates from my HomeDashBoard project and uses Séléné with a graphical plug-in enabled.

## Installation

Clone this package in the directory where you're storing libraries not managed by Luarocks.
For me it's "**/usr/local/lib/lua**" and ensure your LUA_PATH contains 
```/usr/local/lib/lua/?.lua;/home/laurent/Projets/?/init.lua
